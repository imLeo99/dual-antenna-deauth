# RF Noise Generator (for Experimental Use Only)

## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

This project is strictly for **private RF experimentation and educational purposes only**.  
**Do not use this in public spaces, near critical infrastructure, or outside of shielded test environments.**

Transmitting constant carrier signals and hopping channels intentionally can interfere with legitimate wireless communications.  
**Unauthorized use may violate local laws and radio regulations. Misuse may result in criminal charges or equipment confiscation.**  
**Use responsibly. You are solely liable for what you do with this code.**

## 📡 Project Overview

This project uses an **E@#?** microcontroller and an **N?!??@?#?#** wireless module to generate deliberate RF interference.  
It works by:

- Rapidly switching frequencies (channel hopping)
- Transmitting a constant carrier signal at each channel

This creates a wideband RF noise effect that can be used to test how other **N?!??@?#?#**-based devices respond in noisy environments.

## 🔥 Why It's More Powerful Than a Typical Single-Signal Interferer

Compared to basic single-channel RF noise tools, this generator:

- **Covers more frequencies:** It continuously hops across all available channels
- **Maintains constant transmission:** Floods multiple frequencies over time, making avoidance difficult
- **Simulates real-world interference scenarios:** Like those caused by congested environments or hostile RF conditions

This makes it significantly more effective at testing the robustness of wireless systems and protocols, especially those relying on **N?!??@?#?#** modules.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- One **E@#?** microcontroller (e.g., with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth capabilities)
- One **N?!??@?#?#** module (2.4GHz transceiver)
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- Proper power supply (recommended with capacitor filtering)

## 🚧 Warning: Use in Shielded Environments Only

This is **not** a toy or a prank tool.  
Only use this inside a **Faraday cage** or a fully **shielded lab setup** to avoid unintended RF pollution.  
Never power this in open-air environments or populated areas.

---

## 🧪 Purpose

- Academic RF protocol testing  
- Wireless robustness experiments  
- SDR (Software Defined Radio) learning and signal visualization  
- Penetration testing in **controlled** lab environments
